This is a simple app that I am making that I can mess around with some AI concepts.

The idea came from a anime I watch as a child: Mobile G Gundam Fighter. It has sort of a campy premise, but a interesting one from my micro-econ background;
In the future each nation sponsor a Gundam, a large robot humanoid, to fight as the champion of that nation in a tournament. The winning nation becomes the ruling nation over all of the space colonies. The tournament is broken up into two parts: the first is a free for all where each gundam can choose to instigate a fight with any other. However the fights can only be 1 on 1 fights. The second round is a fight between the remaining gundams after 11 months (or some time period) and is a standard tournament format where each fighter is randomly assigned an opponent out of the remaining opponents until only one is left standing. Why I am interested is because each nation would have a vested interest to make sure that certain nations never have a chance at winning. So, in theory, the USA, Canada, and the UK would agree not to fight each other in order to make sure that there is a higher chance that one of them would win rather than, say, Russia.
